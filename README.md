# Kaggle-DogsVsCats
In this project, I utilized the transfer learning technique to build a CNN model for classifying
images of dogs and cats. 
- I tried several models, including ResNet, Inception and EfficientNetmodel, and found out that EfficientNet seems to outperform others on this data. 
- Aside from the transfer learning, I also leverage image augmentation to increase the number and the variety of
training images, which helps the model to generalize better. 

## Result
The model was trained on 20000 images of dogs and cats, validated on the rest of the 5000 pictures, and ultimately achieved
over 99% accuracy on the validation set.
